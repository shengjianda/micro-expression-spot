## Introduction

The branch megc2022 is the source code the results which are submitted to [ACMMM 2022 Conference : Grand Challenges](https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2022/Track/Grand_Challenges). 

We also improve the algorithm after the challenge. Some latest results are shown below.

## Results

Here shows some results after improve the algorithm, which is better than the results of the code on github.
